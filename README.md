### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In my career, I've worn many hats in the fields of CleanTech, AI/ML, FinTech and BP outsourcing, involved in overseeing a bunch of crucial stuff. At this gig, I handled everything from making sure day-to-day operations ran smoothly to dealing with the budget, legal matters in Ukraine and the US, and even fundraising and investor relations.

I wasn't just sitting around leading the charge on some key projects. I worked closely with different teams to make sure things were done right, on time. My focus was always on making sure these projects lined up with what the company wanted to achieve and helped it grow.

Talking to folks in financial institutions and regulatory bodies worldwide? Yep, that was part of the job. I also had a knack for managing relationships with external vendors, negotiating contracts, and keeping those partnerships alive and kicking.

Numbers and reports were my thing. I crunched them to figure out what was going well and where we could do better. Plus, I kept an eye on industry trends and new tech to keep our products on the cutting edge.

When it came to operations, I didn't just follow the playbook â€“ I wrote it. Developed strategies, crafted business plans, and set up processes from scratch. Found the kinks in the system and fixed them, making sure we used our resources wisely.

I'm not just a desk jockey, though. I've led teams, big and small, across the globe. Kept an eye on performance metrics, making sure we were on track. And yeah, I've done the budget dance, making sure we're not overspending but still getting quality work done.

Working with the customers, it wasn't just about keeping the ship steady; I wanted our service to be top-notch. Built a team from the ground up, trained them, and made sure we were hitting our goals. Listened to what customers were saying, fixed any issues, and worked with other teams to keep everyone happy.

In a nutshell, I've been the go-to person for making things run smoothly, whether it's managing projects, teams, budgets, or operations overall.
